# Anova two way in different conditions
  
The objective of this code is to simplify a new way to work in a dataset with different conditions or variables to be explored.

Then, the code will produce:

1. One output containing an Anova table in format .txt
2. An inspection plot of the assumptions of the anova
3. Boxplots for treatments in each looped condition
